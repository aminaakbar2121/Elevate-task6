Strong Password and Evaluate Its Strength.
Password Strength Evaluation - Stepwise Answers
##
1 # Created multiple passwords with varying complexity such as 'password123', 'P@ssw0rd!',
'Str0ng!Pass#2025', and 'Q!w2E#r4T%y6U^i8O*p0'.
##
2 # Used uppercase, lowercase, numbers, symbols, and different lengths to test complexity.
##
3 #Tested each password on online password strength checkers (example:
passwordmeter.com).
##
4 # Noted down the scores and feedback: 'password123' was weak, 'P@ssw0rd!' was medium,
'Str0ng!Pass#2025' was strong, and 'Q!w2E#r4T%y6U^i8O*p0' was very strong.
₹#
5 # Identified best practices such as using at least 12–16 characters, mixing character types,
avoiding dictionary words, and not reusing passwords.
##
6 # Learned useful tips like using a password manager, enabling MFA, and ensuring
randomness to strengthen security.
##
7 # Researched common password attacks: brute force (trying all combinations), dictionary
attacks (using common words), phishing (tricking users), and credential stuffing (reusing stolen
passwords).
##
8 # Summarized that password complexity and uniqueness directly affect security; longer,
random, mixed-character passwords are much harder to crack.
